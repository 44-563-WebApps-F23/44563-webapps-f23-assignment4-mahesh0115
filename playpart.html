        Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.
        
        Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
        spendthrifts.
        
        Peter Stockmann. Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
        (Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home?
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
        the boys.
        
        Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I
        fancy I hear him coming now.
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the
        door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.
        Hovstad!
        
        Hovstad. Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
        printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.
        
        Peter Stockmann (bowing a little distantly). Good evening. You have
        come on business, no doubt.
        
        Hovstad. Partly. It's about an article for the paper.
        
        Peter Stockmann. So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific
        contributor to the "People's Messenger."
        
        Hovstad. Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger"
        when he has any home truths to tell.
        
        Mrs. Stockmann (to HOVSTAD). But won't you—? (Points to the
        dining-room.)
        
        Peter Stockmann. Quite so, quite so. I don't blame him in the least, as
        a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the
        readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to
        bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad.
        
        Hovstad. I quite agree with you.
        
        Peter Stockmann. Taking one thing with another, there is an excellent
        spirit of toleration in the town—an admirable municipal spirit. And it
        all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to
        unite us—an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of
        every right-minded citizen.
        
        Hovstad. The Baths, yes.
        
        Peter Stockmann. Exactly—-our fine, new, handsome Baths. Mark my
        words, Mr. Hovstad—the Baths will become the focus of our municipal
        life! Not a doubt of it!
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. That is just what Thomas says.
