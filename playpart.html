    <p class ="speech">No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.</p>

    <h4 class = "stochmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class="direction">(smiling)</p>  
    <p class ="speech">Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are spendthrifts.</p>  

    <h4 class="peter">Peter Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class ="speech">Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.</p>

    <h4 class = "stochmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class ="speech"> No, I don't think it is he.</p>
    <p class ="direction">(A knock is heard at the door.)</p>
    <p class ="speech">Come in!</p>
    <p class="direction">(HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.)</p>
    <p class ="speech">Oh, it is you, Mr. Hovstad!</p>

    <h4 class="hovstad"> Hovstad.</h4>
    <p class ="speech">Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the printers. 
        Good evening, Mr. Mayor.</p>
